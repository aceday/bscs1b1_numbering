            Students in computer science often have to work on and learn a lot of practical skills, and using
             those skills can help them become successful and flexible students. In this article, we talk about 13 ways 
             that computer science students can improve their theoretical and practical skills by studying.
             <br>
             <h4>13 computer science student study tips</h4>
             You can use the 13 tips below to help you succeed as a computer science student:
             <br>
             <ol>
                <li>Pursue knowledge outside of courses</li>
                A lot of what you learn comes from what you are taught in class, but you can also learn about things on your own time. For example, if you find out you like a topic that was only briefly talked about in class, you can use your own time to learn more about it while researching it. You can also look into computer science, IT, aerospace, and defense companies to find out what skills they are looking for right now. You can look for internships, part-time, and full-time jobs as part of your research to find out what companies want from potential careers.
                <br>
                <li>2. Avoid last-minute studying</li>
                This is true for almost every subject, but especially for computer science. Because many CS classes have practical exams, studying at the last minute rarely works. This can help you avoid the stress of trying to learn something new right before an exam or other test. It can also help you relax during a test because you won't be worried about the things you tried to learn at the last minute. For instance, if you are taking computer engineering and have an exam where you have to fix a computer, studying how to do so at the last minute could make you nervous during the exam.
                <br>
                <li>Develop theoretical computer skills</li>
                Most of a computer science student's classes are hands-on, but it can still be helpful to learn about theories. One way to do this is to look at the designs of the top computer design companies to see where they are going with their designs. You can also learn about theory by watching how people come up with new ideas for computers and which ideas they test and use in the field. Lastly, you can read about the theories that have been used in computer science in the past and how they changed over time to become the theories that are used today. This will help you understand how computers might change in the future.
                <br>
                <li>Develop practical computer skills</li>
                You can learn most of the practical computer skills you need in classes, but you can also learn some on your own. For example, making small programs over and over can help you learn a lot about programming that you might not learn in a class. You can also learn how to rebuild computer hardware and even build your own computer to fit your needs. You can also learn math that helps you go in the direction you want to go as a computer scientist, and you can find out how computer hardware has changed since modern computers were first made.
                <br>
                <li>Make connections with professors and other students</li>
                One problem that computer science students may face is that much of what they study is personal and keeps them from talking to other people. One way to deal with this is to talk to your professors during their office hours, even if you don't need help with homework or tests. By making connections with them, you can find out about changes in the field and their most recent research. Talking to your professors can also help you make long-lasting connections that will help you find your first job in the field in the future.

                You can also figure out how to deal with the problem by talking to other students in computer science and other fields. Talking to other computer science students can help you learn better ways to study, come up with new ideas for projects, tests, and homework, and give you a sense of belonging in the field. Talking to students in other fields, like math, can help you improve your math skills beyond those of your computer science peers. Talking to students in the arts and humanities can help you come up with creative solutions to problems you might face in class and help you build a network of future professionals from all fields.
                <br>
                <li>Rest and relax</li>
                A big part of studying for any student is taking breaks and relaxing when you need to. Taking multiple classes with different topics and working on assignments all the time can make you tired and lead to a higher rate of burnout. Taking time to relax can help you solve hard problems, come up with creative solutions, and make sure you meet your basic needs, like eating and sleeping. When you're sick, resting can help you get better faster, and knowing when you need to miss school or work to take care of yourself can be a key part of your success.
                <br>
                <li>Schedule time to study throughout a term</li>
                Because it can take a long time to learn the practical parts of computer science, it is important to make your own study schedule. Schools and colleges may give you specific times to study, like a "reading day" before final exams, but you can also use that day to rest and relax. Setting aside a day each week to study can help you get more done and remember important information for your tests. When making your schedule, try to pick days and times when you won't have to worry about things like sports games and club meetings.
                <br>
                <li>Develop your math skills</li>
                For some parts of computer science, you need to know how math works. Getting better at math can make you a more versatile computer science student and help you understand what you're doing. You can get better at math by taking classes that are often recommended by computer science programs. You can also improve your math skills by talking to math students and professors and looking up how to do things on the internet. Lastly, know that you only need to take math classes that help you with your main focus, which is computer science.
